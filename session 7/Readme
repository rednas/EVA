Receptive Field Calculation:

Here are the formulae for calculating Receptive filed:
	jn = jn-1 * s 		 j0 = 1	(initialized to zero)
where 
jn is jump of output 
jn-1 is jump of input
s is strides

	rn = rn-1 +(k-1) * jn-1		 r0=1	(initialized to zero)
where 
rn is receptive field of output 
jn-1 is receptive field of input
k is kernel size

Based on these formulate, the receptive file calculation for the following network is given in the table below
